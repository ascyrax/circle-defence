**Circle Defence** is an exciting Android game where you defend a central shooter from waves of enemies. Strategize, upgrade, and survive as long as you can to earn coins and cash, which you can use to permanently improve your shooter's stats. How long can you last?

  - Bullet damage
  - Shooter attack speed
  - Shooter health
  - Shooter health regeneration
  - Shooter defense (percentage and absolute)
